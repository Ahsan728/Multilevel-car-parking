# Multilevel-car-parking
Automatic multi-stored car parking system is very good substitute for car parking area. Since in modern world, where space has become a very big problem and in the era of miniaturization it’s become a very crucial necessity to avoid the wastage of space in modern big companies and apartments etc. For example, in a space where more than 100 cars need to be parked, it’s a very difficult task to do and also to reduce the wastage of area, this system can be used. This Automatic Car Parking enables the parking of vehicles-floor after floor and thus reducing the space used. Here any number of cars can be park according to requirement. These make the system modernized and even a space-saving one. This idea is developed using Microcontroller. Here program is written according to this idea using microcontroller. This Automatic Car Parking enables the parking of vehicles-floor after floor and thus reducing the space used. Here any number of cars can be park according to requirement. These make the system modernized and evens a space-saving one. Mathematical modelling is also done to identify the least car parking space available among the difference parking places in a city.
